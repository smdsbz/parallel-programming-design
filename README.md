===========================

Backup port for Parallel Programming design -- Fibonacci array and the
Akari / Light-Up problem.

Result
------

A maximum speed-up of 3.5+, on a 4C8T processor, achieved on the Light-Up
problem.

Raw benchmark results and some data visualizations of both questions can be
found at `doc/figures.xlsx`.

Algorithm
---------

Brief introduction of algorithms can be found in corresponding
`doc/*实验报告.pdf` documentations, and analysis in `doc/*思考题.pdf`.
